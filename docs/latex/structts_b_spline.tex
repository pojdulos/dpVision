\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents a B-\/\+Spline which may also be used for NURBS, Bezier curves, lines, and points. NURBS are represented using homogeneous coordinates where the last component of a control point is its weight. Bezier curves are B-\/\+Splines with \textquotesingle{}n\+\_\+ctrlp == order\textquotesingle{} and clamped knot vector making the curve passing through the first and last control point. If a Bezier curve consists of two control points only, we call them a line. Points, ultimately, are just very short lines having only a single control point. Consequently, the degree of a point is zero.

Two dimensional control points are organized as follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}[x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1, ..., x_n-1, y_n-1]
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Tree dimensional control points are organized as follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}[x_0, y_0, z_0, x_1, y_1, z_1, ..., x_n-1, y_n-1, z_n-1]
\end{DoxyVerb}
 ... and so on. NURBS are represented using homogeneous coordinates. For instance, let\textquotesingle{}s say we have a NURBS in 2D consisting of 11 control points where \textquotesingle{}w\+\_\+i\textquotesingle{} is the weight of the i\textquotesingle{}th control point. Then the corresponding control points are organized as follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}[x_0, y_0, w_0, x_1, y_1, w_1, ..., x_10, y_10, w_10]
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Note\+: The fields \textquotesingle{}ctrlp\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}knots\textquotesingle{} share the same array (similar to the approach used in \textquotesingle{}\doxylink{structts_de_boor_net}{ts\+De\+Boor\+Net}\textquotesingle{}). That is, the first elements of this array contain the control points of a spline whereas the last elements contain its knots. Accordingly, you should never free \textquotesingle{}knots\textquotesingle{} explicitly. Using \textquotesingle{}ts\+\_\+bspline\+\_\+free()\textquotesingle{} to free dynamically allocated memory is to be preferred anyway. If \textquotesingle{}ctrlp\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}knots\textquotesingle{} do not share the same array, or at least a consistent block of data, functions provided by Tiny\+Spline my fail because values are copied block wise.
